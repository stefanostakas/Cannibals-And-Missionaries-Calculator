# Missionaries and Cannibals Calculator
A Java application for solving the famous logic game "Missionaries and Cannibals" using the A-Star algorithm.

# Overview
This Java application, called the "Missionaries and Cannibals Calculator", is a solution to the classic puzzle game of the same name. The program uses the A-Star algorithm to find the shortest number of moves to solve the puzzle, which involves safely transporting a set number of missionaries and cannibals across a river using a boat. The application takes as input the number of missionaries, cannibals, boat capacity, and the maximum number of moves the A-Star algorithm should perform before giving up the search for a solution. The program then outputs a list of the moves made to solve the puzzle, making the solution process easier for users.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.nd 
3. Run the application and input the number of missionaries, cannibals, boat capacity, the maximum number of moves the A-Star algorithm should perform.
4. the maximum number of moves the A-Star algorithm should perform.
5. The list of moves made to solve the game will be displayed in the console.
